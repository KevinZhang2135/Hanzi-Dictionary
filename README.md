# Introduction

Hanzi Dict is a simple OCR dictionary extension that allows users to define
Chinese characters and phrases quickly with ease. It is, however, not a 
translating service. Rather, it is primarily designed for learners or for those
with language attrition to refine their familiarity with Chinese by sifting
through the meanings of each word to synthesize their overall translation.

## Usage

The dictionary is relatively easy to use - the extension opens a search query
that allows users to retrieve their definitions. For phrases not found in the 
dictionary, the input is segmented into is components for users to individually
check their definitions.

## Features

- CEDICT Dictionary lookup
- Jieba Chinese word segmentation (“结巴”中文分词) web assembly 
- (planned) Tesseract OCR detection
